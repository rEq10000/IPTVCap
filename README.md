# IPTVCap

This is a little Python script to automatically capture images from IPTV stream.
I am not providing any IPTV links, you have to find them by yourself.

## How it works?
FFmpeg does the main work, Python is just to easily fill the gaps like the link, filename and channel name in the command.
You can download FFmpeg for Windows from [here](https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/)
